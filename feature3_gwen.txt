There once was a ship that put to sea
And the name of that ship was the Billy o' Tea
The winds blew hard, her bow dipped down
Blow, me bully boys, blow (Huh!)

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguin' is done
We'll take our leave and go

She had not been two weeks from shore
When down on her a right whale bore
The captain called all hands and swore
He'd take that whale in tow (Hah!)

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguin' is done
We'll take our leave and go

Before the boat had hit the water
The whale's tail came up and caught her
All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her
When she dived down below (Huh!)

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguin' is done
We'll take our leave and go

No line was cut, no whale was freed;
The Captain's mind was not on greed
But he belonged to the whaleman's creed;
She took that ship in tow (Huh!)

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguin' is done
We'll take our leave and go

For forty days, or even more
The line went slack, then tight once more
All boats were lost, there were only four
But still that whale did go

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguin' is done
We'll take our leave and go

As far as I've heard, the fight's still on;
The line's not cut and the whale's not gone
The Wellerman makes his a regular call
To encourage the Captain, crew, and all

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguin' is done
We'll take our leave and go

Soon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tonguin' is done
We'll take our leave and go

There once was a stock that put to sea

The name of the stock was $GME

The price blew up, the shorts dipped down

Hold my bully boys hold

​

Soon may the tendieman come

to send our rocket into the sun

One day when the trading is done

we'll take our gains and go

​

She had not been two weeks from shore

When Ryan Cohen joined the board

The captain called all hands and swore

He'll take his shares and hold

​

Soon may the tendieman come

to send our rocket into the sun

One day when the trading is done

we'll take our gains and go

​

Before the news had hit the market

Wall Street Bets came up and bought it

with diamond hands they knew they'd profit

if they could only hold

​

Soon may the tendieman come

to send our rocket into the sun

One day when the trading is done

we'll take our gains and go

​

No deals were cut, no shorts were squeezed

The captain's mind was not on greed

But he belonged to the autist's creed

He took the risk to hold

​

Soon may the tendieman come

to send our rocket into the sun

One day when the trading is done

we'll take our gains and go

​

For forty days or even more

the stock went up then down once more

All gains were lost, it was looking poor

but still those traders did hold

​

Soon may the tendieman come

to send our rocket into the sun

One day when the trading is done

we'll take our gains and go

​

As far as I've heard the fights still on

the shorts not squeezed and the gains not won

The tendieman makes his regular call

to encourage the captain, crew and all

​

Soon may the tendieman come

to send our rocket into the sun

One day when the trading is done

we'll take our gains and go

​

Soon may the tendieman come

to send our rocket into the sun

One day when the trading is done

we'll take our gains and go
